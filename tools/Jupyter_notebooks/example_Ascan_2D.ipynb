    "### 1. Determine the constitutive parameters for the materials\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be three different materials in the model representing air, the dielectric half-space, and the metal cylinder. Air (free space) already exists as a built-in material in gprMax which can be accessed using the ``free_space`` identifier. The metal cylinder will be modelled as a Perfect Electric Conductor, which again exists as a built-in material in gprMax and can be accessed using the ``pec`` identifier. So the only material which has to be defined is for the dielectric half-space. It is a non-magnetic material, i.e. $\\mu_r=1$ and $\\sigma_*=0$ and with a relative permittivity of six, $\\epsilon_r=6$, and zero conductivity, $\\sigma=0$. The identifier ``half_space`` will be used.\n",

    "\n",
    "These should generally be known, often based on the GPR system or scenario being modelled. Low frequencies are used where significant penetration depth is important, whereas high frequencies are used where less penetration and better resolution are required. In this case a theoretical Hertzian dipole source fed with a Ricker waveform with a centre frequency of $f_c=1.5~\\textrm{GHz}$ will be used to simulate the GPR antenna (see the bowtie antenna example model for how to include a model of the actual GPR antenna in the simulation).\n",
