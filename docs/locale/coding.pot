msgid "The code has been written in Python (3.x) with performance-critical parts, i.e. the FDTD solver, written using Cython (for CPU) or the NVIDIA CUDA programming model (for GPU). Cython allows the CPU-based solver to be parallelised using OpenMP which enables it to run on multi-core CPUs. gprMax also features a Messaging Passing Interface (MPI) task farm, which can operate with CPU nodes or multiple GPUs."
