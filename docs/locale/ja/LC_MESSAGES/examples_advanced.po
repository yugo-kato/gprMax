"This example demonstrates how to build a more realistic soil model using "
"a stochastic distribution of dielectric properties. A mixing model for "
"soils proposed by Peplinski (http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/36.387598) is used"
" to define a series of dispersive material properties for the soil."

" sand fraction 0.5, clay fraction 0.5, bulk density :math:`2~g/cm^3`, "
"sand particle density of :math:`2.66~g/cm^3`, and a volumetric water "

"These materials can then be distributed stochastically over a volume "
"using the ``#fractal_box`` command. Line 11 defines a volume, a fractal "
"dimension, a number of materials, and a mixing model to use. The fractal "
"dimension, 1.5, controls how the materials are stochastically "
"distributed. The fractal weightings, 1, 1, 1, weight the fractal in the "
"x, y, and z directions. The number of materials, 50, specifies how many "
"dispersive materials to create using the mixing model (``my_soil``)."
