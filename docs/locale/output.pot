msgid "gprMax produces an output file that has the same name as the input file but with ``.out`` appended. The output file uses the widely-supported `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ format which was designed to store and organize large amounts of numerical data. There are a number of free tools available to read HDF5 files. Also MATLAB has high- and low-level functions for reading and writing HDF5 files, i.e. ``h5info`` and ``h5disp`` are useful for returning information and displaying the contents of HDF5 files respectively. gprMax includes some Python modules (in the ``tools`` package) to help you view output data. These are documented in the :ref:`tools section <plotting>`."
