msgid "The match between the analytical and numerically modelled solutions is excellent. The maximum difference is approximately 1%, which is observed in the Ez field component (the same direction as the Hertzian dipole source). The other electric field components exhibit maximum differences of approximately 0.5%, and the magnetic field components 0.25%."

The resonant frequency and input impedance from the model agree very well with the theoretical predictions for a half-wave dipole antenna."
