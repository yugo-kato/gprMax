#: ../source/features.rst:98
msgid "gprMax has always included the ability to represent dispersive materials using a single-pole Debye model. Many materials can be adequately represented using this approach for the typical frequency ranges associated with GPR. However, multi-pole Debye, Drude and Lorentz functions are often used to simulate the electric susceptibility of materials such as: water [PIE2009]_, human tissue [IRE2013]_, cold plasma [LI2013]_, gold [VIA2005]_, and soils [BER1998]_, [GIAK2012]_, [TEI1998]_. Electric susceptibility relates the polarization density to the electric field, and includes both the real and imaginary parts of the complex electric permittivity variation. In the new version of gprMax a recursive convolution based method is used to express dispersive properties as apparent current density sources [GIA2014]_. A major advantage of this implementation is that it creates an inclusive susceptibility function that holds, as special cases, Debye, Drude and Lorentz materials. For further details see the :ref:`material commands section <materials>`."

#: ../source/features.rst:103
msgid "The inclusion of improved models of soils is important for many GPR simulations. gprMax can now be used to create soils with more realistic dielectric and geometrical properties. A semi-empirical model, initially suggested by [DOB1985]_, is used to describe the dielectric properties of the soil. The model relates relative permittivity of the soil to bulk density, sand particle density, sand fraction, clay fraction and water volumetric fraction. Using this approach, a more realistic soil with a stochastic distribution of the aforementioned parameters can be modelled. The real and imaginary parts of this semi-empirical model can be approximated using a multi-pole Debye function plus a conductive term. This can now be achieved in gprMax using the new dispersive material functionality. For further details see the :ref:`material commands section <materials>`."

msgid "Fractals are scale invariant functions which can express the topography of the earth for a wide range of scales with sufficient detail [TUR1987]_. For this reason fractals have been chosen to represent the topography of soils. Fractals can be generated by the convolution of Gaussian noise with an inverse Fourier transform of :math:`\\frac{1}{kb}`, where :math:`k` is the wavenumber and :math:`b` is a constant related to the fractal dimension [TUR1997]_. gprMax can now generate heterogeneous volumes (boxes) with realistic soil properties that can have rough surfaces applied. For further details see the :ref:`fractal object building commands section <fractals>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/features.rst:107
msgid "Fractal correlated noise [TUR1997]_ is used to describe the stochastic distribution of the properties of soils. This approach has been chosen because it has been shown that soil-related environmental properties frequently obey fractal laws [BUR1981]_, [HILL1998]_.

Standard isotropic objects specify one material identifier that defines the same properties in x, y, and z directions. However, every volumetric object building command can also be specified with three material identifiers, which allows properties for the x, y, and z directions to be separately defined."

To address this question gprMax includes an option to turn dielectric smoothing on or off for volumetric object building commands. The default behaviour (if no option is specified) is for dielectric smoothing to be on. The option can be specified with a single character ``y`` (on) or ``n`` (off) given after the material identifier in each object command. When dielectric smoothing is on gprMax calculates the arithmetic mean of the electric and magnetic properties of the surrounding Yee cells, to use for the single Yee cell edge (boundary) of interest."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/features.rst:134
msgid "With increased research into quantitative information from GPR, it has become necessary for models to be able to have more efficient and better-performing Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions. Since 2005 gprMax has featured PML absorbing boundary conditions based on the uniaxial PML (UPML) [GED1998]_ formulation. A PML based on a recursive integration approach to the complex frequency shifted (CFS) PML [GIA2012]_ has been adopted in the new version of gprMax. A general formulation of this RIPML, which can be used to develop any order of PML, has been used to implement first and second order CFS stretching functions. One of the attractions of the RIPML is that it is easily applied as a correction to the field quantities after the complete FDTD grid has been updated using the standard FDTD update equations. gprMax now offers the ability (for advanced users) to customise the parameters of the PML which allows its performance to be better optimised for specific applications. Additionally, since the RIPML is media agnostic it can be used without change to problems involving dispersive and anisotropic materials. For further details see the :ref:`PML commands section <pml-commands>`."
