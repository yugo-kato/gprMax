msgid "There will be three different materials in the model representing air, the dielectric half-space, and the metal cylinder. Air (free space) already exists as a built-in material in gprMax which can be accessed using the ``free_space`` identifier. The metal cylinder will be modelled as a Perfect Electric Conductor, which again exists as a built-in material in gprMax and can be accessed using the ``pec`` identifier. So the only material which has to be defined is for the dielectric half-space. It is a non-magnetic material, i.e. :math:`\\mu_r=1` and :math:`\\sigma_*=0` and with a relative permittivity of six, :math:`\\epsilon_r=6`, and zero conductivity, :math:`\\sigma=0`. The identifier ``half_space`` will be used."

Low frequencies are used where significant penetration depth is important, whereas high frequencies are used where less penetration and better resolution are required. In this case a theoretical Hertzian dipole source fed with a Ricker waveform with a centre frequency of :math:`f_c=1.5~\\textrm{GHz}` will be used to simulate the GPR antenna (see the :ref:`bowtie antenna example model <example-bowtie>` for how to include a model of the actual GPR antenna in the simulation)."

The Hertzian dipole source is created using the ``#hertzian_dipole`` command, specifying a z direction polarisation (perpendicular to the survey direction if a B-scan were being created), location on the surface of the slab, and using the Ricker waveform already created."

To determine the smallest wavelength, the highest frequency and lowest velocity present in the model are required. The highest frequency is not the centre frequency of the Ricker waveform! :ref:`By examining the spectrum of a Ricker waveform <waveforms>` it is evident much higher frequencies are present, i.e. at a level -40dB from the centre frequency, frequencies 2-3 times as high are present. In this case the highest significant frequency present in the model is likely to be around 4 GHz. The wavelength at 4 GHz in the half-space (which has the lowest velocity) would be:"

In this case the plan is to take a B-scan of the scenario (in the next example) so the domain should be large enough to do that.

The ``#src_steps`` command is used to move every source in the model by specified steps each time the model is run. Similarly, the ``#rx_steps`` command is used to move every receiver in the model by specified steps each time the model is run.
