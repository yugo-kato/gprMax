#: ../source/user_libs_antenna_patterns.rst:22
msgid "Does not calculate/plot conventional field patterns, i.e. at a single frequency. It uses a measure of the total energy of the electric field at a certain angle and radius, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.08.001"

#: ../source/user_libs_antenna_patterns.rst:24
msgid "Can require simulations that demand significant computational resource depending on the distance from the antenna at which the field patterns are observed, e.g. the example models, set with a maximum observation distance of 0.6m, require ~30GB of RAM"

#: ../source/user_libs_antenna_patterns.rst:41
msgid "Firstly you should familiarise yourself with the example model input file. Edit the input file as desired and run one of the simulations for either E-plane or H-plane patterns."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/user_libs_antenna_patterns.rst:43
msgid "Once the simulation has completed, run the ``initial_save.py`` module on the output file, e.g. for the E-plane ``python -m user_libs.antenna_patterns.initial_save user_models/antenna_like_GSSI_1500_patterns_E_Er5.out``. This will produce a Numpy file containing the field pattern data."

#: ../source/user_libs_antenna_patterns.rst:48
