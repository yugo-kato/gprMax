In Maxwell's equations, the field vectors are assumed to be single-valued, bounded, continuous functions of position and time. In order to simulate the GPR response from a particular target or set of targets the above equations have to be solved subject to the geometry of the problem and the initial conditions."

msgid "The nature of the GPR forward problem classifies it as an *initial value -- open boundary* problem. This means that in order to obtain a solution you have to define an initial condition (i.e. excitation of the GPR transmitting antenna) and allow for the resulting fields to propagate through space reaching a zero value at infinity since, there is no specific boundary which limits the geometry of the problem and where the electromagnetic fields can take a predetermined value. Although the first part is easy to accommodate (i.e. specification of the source), the second part cannot be easily tackled using a finite computational space."

msgid "The FDTD approach to the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations is to discretize both the space and time continua. Thus the discretization spatial :math:`\\Delta x`, :math:`\\Delta y` and :math:`\\Delta z` and temporal :math:`\\Delta t` steps play a very significant role -- since the smaller they are the closer the FDTD model is to a real representation of the problem. However, the values of the discretization steps always have to be finite, since computers have a limited amount of storage and finite processing speed. Hence, the FDTD model represents a discretized version of the real problem and is of limited size. The building block of this discretized FDTD grid is the Yee cell [YEE1966]_ named after Kane Yee who pioneered the FDTD method. This is illustrated for the 3D case in :numref:`yeecell3D`."

msgid "gprMax is fundamentally based on solving Maxwell's equations in 3D using the FDTD method - transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. However, it can also be used to carry out simulations in 2D using the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. This is achieved through specifying a single cell slice of the domain, i.e. one dimension of the domain must be equal to the spatial discretization in that direction. When this occurs the electric and magnetic field components on the two faces of single cell slice in the invariant direction are set to zero. This is illustrated for the 2D TMz case in :numref:`yeecell2DTMz`."

msgid "One of the most challenging issues in modelling *open boundary* problems, such as GPR, is the truncation of the computational domain at a finite distance from sources and targets where the values of the electromagnetic fields can not be calculated directly by the numerical method applied inside the model. Hence, an approximate condition known as *absorbing boundary condition (ABC)* is applied at a sufficient distance from the source to truncate and therefore limit the computational space. The role of this ABC is to absorb any waves impinging on it, hence simulating an unbounded space. The computational space (i.e the model) limited by the ABCs should contain all important features of the model such as sources and output points and targets. :numref:`abcs` illustrates this basic difference between the problem to be modelled and the actual FDTD modelled space."

msgid "It is assumed that the half-space which contains the target(s) is of infinite extent. Therefore, the only reflected waves will be the ones originating from the target. In cases where the host medium is not of infinite extent (e.g. a finite concrete slab) the assumption of infinite extent can be made as far as the actual reflections from the slab termination are not of interest or its actual size is large enough that any reflected waves which will originate at its termination will not affect the solution for the required time window. In general, any objects that span the size of the computational domain (i.e. model) are assumed to extend to infinity. The only reflections which will originate from their termination at the truncation boundaries of the model are due to imperfections of the ABCs and in general are of a very small amplitude compared with the reflections from target(s) inside the model."

msgid "The ABCs employed in gprMax will, in general, perform well (i.e. without introducing significant artificial reflections) if all sources and targets are kept at least 15 cells away from them. gprMax uses Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) ABCs based on a recursive integration approach to the complex frequency shifted (CFS) PML [GIA2012]_. A general formulation of this RIPML, which can be used to develop any order of PML, has been used to implement first and second order CFS stretching functions. One of the attractions of the RIPML is that it is easily applied as a correction to the field quantities after the complete FDTD grid has been updated using the standard FDTD update equations."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/gprmodelling.rst:134
msgid "The cells of the RIPML, which have a user adjustable thickness, very efficiently absorb most waves that propagate in them. Although, source and output points can be specified inside these cells **it is wrong to do so** from the point of view of correct modelling. The fields inside these cells are not of interest to GPR modelling. Placing sources inside these cells could have effects that have not been studied and will certainly provide erroneous results from the perspective of GPR modelling. The requirement to keep sources and targets at least 15 cells away for the PML has to be taken into account when deciding the size of the model domain. Additionally, free space (i.e. air) should be always included above a source for at least 15-20 cells in GPR models. Obviously, the more cells there are between observation points, sources, targets and the absorbing boundaries, the better the results will be."
