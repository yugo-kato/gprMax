msgid "An input file has to be supplied to gprMax which should contain all the necessary information to run a GPR model. The input file is an ASCII text file which can be prepared with any text editor or word-processing program. In the input file the hash character (``#``) is reserved and is used to denote the beginning of a command which will be passed to gprMax. The general syntax of commands is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/input.rst:13
msgid "A command and associated parameters should occupy a single line of the input file, and only one command per line is allowed. Hence, the first character of a line containing a command **must** be the hash character (``#``). If the line starts with **any other character** it is ignored by the program. Therefore, user comments or descriptions can be included in the input file. If a line starts with a hash character (``#``) the program will expect a valid command. If the name of the command is not correct the program will abandon execution and issue an error message. When a command requires more than one parameter then these should be separated using a white space character."

Should the last object to be defined at that location dictate the properties? Should an average set of properties of the materials of the objects that share that location be used? This latter option is often referred to as dielectric smoothing and has been shown to result in more accurate simulations [LUE1994]_ [BOU1996]_. To address this question gprMax includes an option to turn dielectric smoothing on or off for volumetric object building commands. The default behaviour (if no option is specified) is for dielectric smoothing to be on. The option can be specified with a single character ``y`` (on) or ``n`` (off) given after the material identifier in each object command. For example to specify a sphere of material ``sand`` with dielectric smoothing turned off use: ``#sphere: 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.1 sand n``."
