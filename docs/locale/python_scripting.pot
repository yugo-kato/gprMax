msgid "The input file has now been made scriptable by permitting blocks of Python code to be specified between ``#python`` and ``#end_python`` commands. The code is executed when the input file is read by gprMax. You don't need any external tools, such as MATLAB, to generate larger, more complex input files for building intricate models. Python scripting means that gprMax now includes :ref:`libraries of more complex objects, such as antennas <antennas>`, that can be easily inserted into a model. You can also access a number of built-in constants from your Python code."
